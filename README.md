- gnuradio-spectrum-fm-nhk.grc: simple configuration that just connects
  the source to a FFT visualizer so that you can see a peak at 82.5MHz
  which is the NHK channel in Tokyo.

- gnuradio-spectrum-and-listen-fm-nhk.grc: allows decoding and listening to
  the FM NHK channel in Tokyo. So it includes filters, an FM receiver, an
  audio sink and custom sliders for tuning.
